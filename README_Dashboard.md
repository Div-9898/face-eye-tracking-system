### Modifying Colors/Theme
The dashboard uses custom CSS for styling. You can modify the CSS in the markdown section (lines 20-90) to change colors, fonts, or layout.

Each dashboard view is a separate function (e.g., `show_overview()`, `show_sales_analysis()`). You can add new visualizations within these functions or create new dashboard views.

## Performance Tips

1. **Data Caching**: The app uses Streamlit's caching to load data once and reuse it
2. **Filtering**: Use filters to reduce data volume for faster rendering
3. **Large Datasets**: Consider sampling or aggregating data for very large files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **File not found error**: Check that the Excel file path is correct
2. **Module not found**: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. **Port already in use**: Try `streamlit run global_superstore_dashboard.py --server.port 8502`
